## Networks top-level element

Networks are the layer that allow services to communicate with each other. The networking model exposed to a service
is limited to a simple IP connection with target services and external resources, while the Network definition allows
fine-tuning the actual implementation provided by the platform.

Networks can be created by specifying the network name under a top-level `networks` section.
Services can connect to networks by specifying the network name under the service [`networks`](05-services.md#networks) subsection

In the following example, at runtime, networks `front-tier` and `back-tier` will be created and the `frontend` service
will be connected to `front-tier` and `back-tier` networks.

```yml
services:
  frontend:
    image: awesome/webapp
    networks:
      - front-tier
      - back-tier

networks:
  front-tier:
  back-tier:
```

### driver

`driver` specifies which driver should be used for this network. Compose returns an error if the
driver is not available on the platform.

```yml
networks:
  mynet1:
    driver: overlay
```

Default and available values are platform specific. Compose specification must support the following specific drivers:
`none` and `host`

- `host` use the host's networking stack
- `none` disable networking

#### host or none

The syntax for using built-in networks such as `host` and `none` is different, as such networks implicitly exist outside
the scope of Compose. To use them, one must define an external network with the name `host` or `none` and
an alias that Compose can use (`hostnet` and `nonet` in the following examples), then grant the service
access to that network using its alias.

```yml
services:
  web:
    networks:
      hostnet: {}

networks:
  hostnet:
    external: true
    name: host
```

```yml
services:
  web:
    ...
    networks:
      nonet: {}

networks:
  nonet:
    external: true
    name: none
```

### driver_opts

`driver_opts` specifies a list of options as key-value pairs to pass to the driver for this network. These options are
driver-dependent - consult the driver's documentation for more information. Optional.

```yml
networks:
  mynet1:
    driver_opts:
      foo: "bar"
      baz: 1
```

### attachable

If `attachable` is set to `true`, then standalone containers should be able to attach to this network, in addition to services.
If a standalone container attaches to the network, it can communicate with services and other standalone containers
that are also attached to the network.

```yml
networks:
  mynet1:
    driver: overlay
    attachable: true
```

### enable_ipv6

`enable_ipv6` enable IPv6 networking on this network.

### ipam

`ipam` specifies custom a IPAM configuration. This is an object with several properties, each of which is optional:

- `driver`: Custom IPAM driver, instead of the default.
- `config`: A list with zero or more configuration elements, each containing:
  - `subnet`: Subnet in CIDR format that represents a network segment
  - `ip_range`: Range of IPs from which to allocate container IPs
  - `gateway`: IPv4 or IPv6 gateway for the master subnet
  - `aux_addresses`: Auxiliary IPv4 or IPv6 addresses used by Network driver, as a mapping from hostname to IP
- `options`: Driver-specific options as a key-value mapping.

A full example:

```yml
ipam:
  driver: default
  config:
    - subnet: 172.28.0.0/16
      ip_range: 172.28.5.0/24
      gateway: 172.28.5.254
      aux_addresses:
        host1: 172.28.1.5
        host2: 172.28.1.6
        host3: 172.28.1.7
  options:
    foo: bar
    baz: "0"
```

### internal

By default, Compose provides external connectivity to networks. `internal`, when set to `true`, allows
creating an externally isolated network.

### labels

Add metadata to containers using Labels. Can use either an array or a dictionary.

Users should use reverse-DNS notation to prevent labels from conflicting with those used by other software.

```yml
networks:
  mynet1:
    labels:
      com.example.description: "Financial transaction network"
      com.example.department: "Finance"
      com.example.label-with-empty-value: ""
```

```yml
networks:
  mynet1:
    labels:
      - "com.example.description=Financial transaction network"
      - "com.example.department=Finance"
      - "com.example.label-with-empty-value"
```

Compose sets `com.docker.compose.project` and `com.docker.compose.network` labels.

### external

If set to `true`, `external` specifies that this networkâ€™s lifecycle is maintained outside of that of the application.
Compose doesn't attempt to create these networks, and should raise an error if one doesn't exist.

If `external` is set to `true` and network configuration has other but `name` attributes set, considering resource is
not managed by compose lifecycle, Compose rejects the Compose file as invalid.

In the example below, `proxy` is the gateway to the outside world. Instead of attempting to create a network, Compose
queries the platform for an existing network simply called `outside` and connect the
`proxy` service's containers to it.

```yml

services:
  proxy:
    image: awesome/proxy
    networks:
      - outside
      - default
  app:
    image: awesome/app
    networks:
      - default

networks:
  outside:
    external: true
```

### name

`name` sets a custom name for this network. The name field can be used to reference networks which contain special characters.
The name is used as is and will **not** be scoped with the project name.

```yml
networks:
  network1:
    name: my-app-net
```

It can also be used in conjunction with the `external` property to define the platform network that Compose
should retrieve, typically by using a parameter so the Compose file doesn't need to hard-code runtime specific values:

```yml
networks:
  network1:
    external: true
    name: "${NETWORK_ID}"
```
